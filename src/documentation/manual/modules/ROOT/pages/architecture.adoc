= Architecture

The main goal of Jolokia is to allow remote access to MBeans available in one or more `javax.management.MBeanServer`
instances present in a JVM. This goal more or less matches the intent of https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160[JSR-160 JMX Remote specification].

While JSR-160 (which is actually incorporated into JSR-3 as part III "JMX Remote API Specification") mentions two remote access methods

* _connectors_
* _protocol adaptors_, 

the emphasis is put on the _connectors_ (and in particular an RMI connector), while _protocol adaptors_ are summarized with:

____
For example, an HTML adaptor could display an MBean on a Web browser.
The view provided by protocol adaptors is necessarily different for each protocol
and *none are addressed in this phase of the JMX specification*.
____

JSR-160 _connectors_ are designed in a way that the client can transparently
invoke MBean calls, regardless whether the MBean resides within a
local or remote MBeanServer. This provides a good deal of
comfort for Java clients of this API, but it is also dangerous
_because_ it hides the remoteness of JMX
calls. There are several subtle issues, performance
being one of them. It _does_ matter whether a
call is invoked locally or remotely. A caller should at least be
aware what happens and what the consequences are. On the other
hand, there are message-passing models which include remoting
explicitly, so that the caller _knows_ from
the programming model that she is calling a potentially expensive
remote call. This is probably the main reason why RMI (the default
protocol stack of JSR-160 connectors) lost market share to
more explicit remote protocols.

One problem with JSR-160 mandatory RMI connector is its reliance on RMI and its
requirement for a complete (Java) object serialization mechanism
for passing management information over the wire. This closes the
door for all environments which are not Java (or more precisely, JVM)
aware. Jolokia uses a typeless approach, where some sort of
lightweight serialization to JSON is used (in both directions, but
a bit _asymmetrically_ in its capabilities). Of course
this approach has some drawbacks, too, but also quite some
advantages. At least, it is unique in the JMX world ;-).

Thus, the architecture of Jolokia is built on the concept of JSR-160 _protocol adaptor_ with a big dose of flexibility.
One of the most striking difference is Jolokia's typeless approach: messages sent over HTTP are represented
with JSON format.

[#agent-mode]
== Agent mode

<<fig-architecture-overview>> illustrates the
environment in which Jolokia operates. The agent exports on the
frontside a JSON-based protocol over HTTP that gets bridged to
invocation of local JMX MBeans. It builds on the JSR-160's _protocol adaptor_
concept, and uses a setup not defined by the specification.
This gives Jolokia a lot of flexibility, and various techniques
are available for exporting its protocol via HTTP. The most
prominent being to put the agent into a servlet container. This
can be a lightweight one like Tomcat or Jetty, or a full-blown
Jakarta EE Server. Since it acts like a usual web application, the
deployment of the agent is well understood and should pose no
entry barrier for any developer who has ever dealt with Java web
applications.

But there are more options. Specialized agents are able to use an OSGi
mechanism for exposing web components (https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard Specification for Jakartaâ„¢ Servlet,role=externalLink,window=_blank] in Jolokia 2 and https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.html[OSGi CMPN HTTP Service,role=externalLink,window=_blank] in Jolokia 1).
The JVM agent uses the HTTP-Server included
with every modern JVM, and can be attached dynamically to any
running Java process. Agents are described in detail in
xref:agents.adoc[].

Jolokia can be also integrated
into one's own applications very easily. The `jolokia-server-core`
library (which comes bundled as a jar), includes a servlet
which can be easily added to a custom application.
xref:agents.adoc#agent-war-programmatic[Programmatic usage of the Jolokia agent servlet] contains more information
about this.

[#proxy-mode]
== Proxy Mode

Proxy mode is a solution for the scenario when it is impossible to deploy
the Jolokia agent on the target platform. For this mode, the
only prerequisite for accessing the target server is a JSR-160
server connector. Most of the time, this happens for political reasons,
where it is simply not allowed to deploy an extra piece of
software or where doing so requires a lengthy approval process.
Another reason could be that the target server already
exports JMX via JSR-160 and you want to avoid the extra step of
deploying the agent.

This setup is a bridge scenario that hides complexity of JSR-160 remote connector acces and client uses
Jolokia protocol to access Jolokia agent, which in turn uses standard (but a bit complex) `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection` to call target server.

A dedicated proxy servlet container is needed for hosting
`jolokia-agent-war`, which by default supports both
the _agent mode_ and the _proxy
mode_. A lightweight container like Tomcat or Jetty is
a perfect choice for this kind of setup.

Figure <<fig-architecture-proxy>> describes a typical setup for the proxy mode. A
client sends a usual Jolokia request containing an extra section
to specify the target which should be queried. All routing
information is contained in the request itself, so that the proxy
can act universally without the need of a specific
configuration.

Having said all that, the proxy mode has some limitations which are
listed in xref:proxy_mode.adoc[].

To summarize, the proxy mode should be used only when
required. The agent servlet on its own is more powerful than the
proxy mode since it eliminates an additional layer adding to the
overall complexity and performance. Also, some features like
merging of MBeanServers (exposing a unified view) are not available in the proxy mode.
